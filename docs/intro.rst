Introduction
============

Tabulate is designed to be an easy-to-use database system, aimed at anyone comfortable using spreadsheets.
It can be used to manage any type of tabular data,
and provides the power of the database for managing things like
column data types, field cross-references, and searching the data in a number of ways.
In addition, it provides user- and group-management, access-control, and a change-tracking mechanism.

The fundamental components of a Tabulate site are the *tables*.
A table in Tabulate is just a standard database table, with columns of defined types and rows that contain your data.
Initially, the system only contains the tables required for authentication, authorisation, and change-tracking;
the first task after installation is to start creating the tables that you need for your own site.

Tabulate can be used to manage any sort of data, from the small and personal to the large and institutional.
Got a book collection that you want to catalogue?
Or a rain gauge that you measure daily?
How about a fleet of vehicles whose service history you need to keep track of?
A couple of hundred thousand environmental monitoring points all sending you data?
All can be kept centrally and securely in a Tabulate site.

Basically, a Tabulate site is **just a database**, and can be used for whatever you would use a database for.
It is a step beyond the usual spreadsheet-based data management scenario that is all too common...
it is a step *prior* to a bespoke web application, however
(although extensive customisation is possible, and Tabulate can be thought of as a prototyping system in some ways).
