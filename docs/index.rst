Tabulate User Manual
====================

Tabulate is a user-friendly web database interface, designed to make it easy to work with relational tabular data.

Quick-start
-----------

Looking for the `TL;DR`_? Here it is!

.. _`TL;DR`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR

1. Install the application (create ``config.php`` then run ``./tabulate upgrade``)
2. Log in as ``admin`` with password ``admin``
3. Go to the administration area and create some tables
4. Start creating or importing data.

Learning more
-------------

For more information, you can work through this documentation.
It is written to be read in order but should be reasonably easy to dip into wherever you want.

If anything doesn't make sense, or the operation of the software doesn't match what's here,
we'd be very grateful if you could `raise an issue`_ on GitHub to let us know.

.. _`raise an issue`: https://github.com/tabulate/tabulate3/issues

We're trying to write Tabulate in a *test-first* manner,
in that all new features and bug fixes are preceeded by test code that ensures their correct operation.
We're also trying to *document-first*:
no code, not even test cases, is written until the documentation has been created or updated
to match what we're trying to make the software do.
The stable_ version of the documentation, therefore, is complete and can be read as instructions of how to use Tabulate
|---| the latest_ version, however, may at times be a bit *avant-garde*
and not (yet) make any sense with respect to what you'll see on an installed site.
