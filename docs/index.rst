Welcome to Tabulate's documentation!
====================================

Tabulate is a user-friendly web database interface, designed to make it easy to work with relational tabular data.

Quick-start
-----------

Looking for the **tl;dr**? Here it is!

1. Install the application (create ``config.php`` then run ``./tabulate upgrade``)
2. Log in as ``admin`` with password ``admin``
3. Go to the administration area and create some tables
4. Start creating or importing data.

For more information, you can work through this documentation.
It is written to be read in order but should be reasonably easy to dip into wherever you want.
